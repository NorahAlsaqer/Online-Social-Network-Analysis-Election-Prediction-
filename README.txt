How to Run
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the dataset using the provided scripts:

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocess_data.py
Step 2: Sentiment Analysis
Run the sentiment analysis module:
jupyter notebooks

bash
Copy code
python src/sentiment_analysis.py
This generates:

Polarity scores for each tweet.
Visualizations for sentiment distribution.
Step 3: Geospatial Sentiment Mapping
To generate geospatial sentiment maps, use the GIS analysis script:

bash
Copy code
python src/geospatial_analysis.py
This produces maps stored in the images/ directory.

Step 4: Predictive Modeling
Train and evaluate models:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
You can evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes models. Results will be saved in the results/ folder.

Running Jupyter Notebooks
To interactively run the project in Jupyter:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebooks/ directory and select the desired .ipynb file.

Outputs and Results
Visualizations: Graphs and maps generated during sentiment and geospatial analysis are stored in images/.
Model Results: Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are saved in results/.
Key Results:

Random Forest achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 82.1%.
Democrats maintained a higher positive sentiment, while Republicans exhibited more polarized sentiment.
